                        <p>Welcome to Reqelford International School’s dynamic Website. This vibrant walkthrough is a
                            kaleidoscopic display of what the school has in store for you right from Academic and
                            Administrative
                            policies, Superior Infrastructure, Sports Facilities to myriad happenings, year-long events
                            and
                            activities of our students. At Reqelford International school we are continuously striving
                            to
                            implement life skills for students into their curriculum. Malcom S. Forbe once said, “The
                            purpose of
                            education is to replace an empty mind with an open one.” It is not a bad thing for children
                            to
                            fail
                            – be it in academics, in sports, or in any competition. A country’s greatest treasure being
                            children, there is a need to teach children to face defeats and failures. This is one of the
                            life
                            skills that is most missing in today’s intensely competitive world. It is our desire to
                            nurture
                            children to balance academic curriculum and skill development. This way, one can instill in
                            children
                            the responsibility of learning and give them the confidence, train them to behave
                            professionally
                            and
                            maintain discipline.

                            If we want India to get its rightful place in the comity of nations, it is imperative that
                            we
                            develop leaders in multiple areas. This leadership development is what Reqelford is working
                            at.
                            The
                            “Reqscientifica’(Science Fair) and ‘Refesta’ (Winter Carnival) events focus on the
                            importance of
                            teamwork and the possibility of being able to lead a team when working on projects. Various
                            activities in academics and the British Council’s ISA (International School Award) projects
                            build a
                            foundation in nurturing creative, communicative, mathematical and thinking skills.

                            The school has also given opportunities for students to engage in activities that help them
                            socialize and to prepare them for the entrepreneurial steps they have to take in their own
                            careers.
                            The literary activities have encouraged students to have critical discussions by debating
                            and
                            writing and get them to research and develop their creative thinking skills. Cultural
                            activities,
                            music, dance and drama and the performing arts motivate and develop children to nurture
                            habits
                            and
                            hobbies, which remain to be lifelong essential skills that guide them to become better
                            individuals.

                            Reqelford strives to build values and skills that are relevant for every child, to prepare
                            students
                            to face the corporate and competitive world in true spirit of self-belief, while
                            understanding
                            and
                            appreciating the challenges they encounter. With the ‘Right Education’ being at the
                            forefront of
                            Global development it is imperative that students develop cross-cultural skill sets
                            encouraging
                            diversity and inclusivity thus broadening their Academic Experiences. A major step taken in
                            this
                            direction is ‘An Academic Agreement’ between Reqelford International School and Dallas
                            Baptist
                            University, USA that will serve as the much needed catalyst to foster an understanding and
                            appreciation of the diverse culture that exists in our world.

                            We look ahead to equipping many more students with the skills that would offer them the
                            advantage to
                            exploit and readily grasp the opportunities that life has to offer. Wishing every
                            Reqelforder a
                            bright future!</p>

                        In the wake of a mammoth upsurge in the number of international schools across the city and
                        beyond, Reqelford International School aspires to be a school with a difference, a school
                        committed to creating new and progressive approaches to teaching and learning, a school not just
                        unique but one that strives to leave a rich legacy behind to be remembered for years to come.To
                        this end, the measures taken by the school is phenomenal. We seek to create in the minds of all
                        our treasured stakeholders a sense of who we are, a sense that reflects our diverse
                        international environment, pulsating student life and the sense ofa vibrantcommunity which
                        exists within our four walls. Myriad opportunities have been provided to students to participate
                        in countless events and bag numerous prizes. For the first time in Reqelford’s history we have
                        students representing the school at the National level in diverse sporting arena be it
                        Basketball, Skating, Shot-put, Badminton, Chess, Soccer or Tennis.House Events and Competitions,
                        Club Activities, Literary and Art Fests further add to this already enriched learning process.
                        Participation in multifarious disciplines like Music, Dance, Quiz and Model UN are vociferously
                        encouraged and now Academic Achievements in particular have touched an all new high!Eight long
                        years and achievements a plenty! We have left no stone unturned to surge ahead and make a mark
                        in the ever-evolving chain of top of the line premium schools within the city.

                        The Digital Revolution having taken the world by storm, the school has taken measures to
                        introduce Tablet learning at certain grades to heighten the levels of learning and increase
                        student motivation and participation in class. Besides this students are constantly coaxed to
                        create digital presentations and present topics as part of Seminars and Projects. To top it all
                        intensive thinking activities are intelligently woven into the teaching pedagogy to ensure group
                        dynamics have a prominent role and the classroom comes alive.Students are also motivated to
                        conduct and host Annual Events like ‘Req-scientifica’, ‘Food Fest – Refesta’ & the Winter
                        Carnival.

                        Much as we impart education to meet the growing demands of educational and technological
                        advancements, we endeavor to ensure our students move ahead with Reqelford’s ethos of moral
                        values and principles based on our very own seven pillars of education viz., knowledge, faith,
                        love, joy, perseverance.

                        The deliberate efforts made by the school in providing a well-rounded education to students will
                        surely in the years to come assure us a place under the pedagogic sun. As for now, while we
                        venture into our ninth year of existence, we hope and pray that we continue to work towards
                        opening up dynamic new vistas of learning and our mission continues to drive our growth and
                        progress.

                even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance management systems
                ensure accurate time records and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with manual data entry. This
                accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data.
                <hr>
                2. Economics Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It saves money by putting an
end to inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, absenteeism, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter of
fact, a study done by the Axsium Group found that large organizations save up to $1,600 per employee after implementing
automated attendance management systems.
